# Pre-Fortress 2 Classic

Do you miss old Pre-Fortress 2... before all those pesky *bug updates* and *crash fixes* and *player sounds* and *animations* and so forth? Well then, we recommend you seek psychiatric treatment **immediately**!

However, since you're already here, might as well enjoy your madness, eh? That's where Pre-Fortress 2 Classic comes in!

This is basically just PF2 0.6 preserved in its buggy, horribly disfigured form! How *wonderous*!


# Q&A


- Can I install this alongside modern Pre-Fortress 2?
  - **Absolutely!** That's the entire point of this, actually!

- Can I install this on Windows or Linux?
  - Yup! The game is compiled for both!
 
- So what has *actually* changed?
  - Changes from PF2 0.6 include:
    - New name!
    - New logo!
    - New intro video!

- I don't see any servers...
  - Feel free to host one!

- What's the future hold for PF2C?
  - Absolutely *nothing!*
 
- Will you add X, Y, or Z?
  - Absolutely not!

- I renamed the folder in sourcemods and am having issues now.
  - *Don't do that.*

- I have *totally legitimate mod that isn't just balloon fempyro* that I want to add to the game, can I ?!?!
  - Probably not, but if it's a TRUE Quality-of-Life improvement, you can make a pull request for it. That would be very much reviewd on a case-by-case basis.
 
- Can we contact you if we run into issues?
  - How dare you even *think* of speaking to me.
  - (Feel free to post in Issues, but most of your problems are probably fixed in actual PF2)
 
- This mod SUCKS! Where can I find the *real* Pre-Fortress 2?!
  - https://prefortress.com/

# Installation

- Same as every other sourcemod, just make sure the folder name for the game is pf2c
